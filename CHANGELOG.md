  - Fetches exchange state once at startup and shares with all services
  - Runs comprehensive health checks before service initialization
  - Manages service dependencies and ensures correct startup order
  - Provides graceful shutdown sequence in reverse dependency order

  - Resolved race condition between PositionMonitor and OrderCleanup services
  - Fixed phantom position detection during database recovery
  - Prevented duplicate API calls for exchange state fetching
  - Added proper synchronization between services during startup
- **Instant Profit Capture -1106 Error** - Fixed critical bug causing "Parameter 'reduceOnly' sent when not required" errors

  - Added conditional logic: `reduceOnly` only sent in one-way mode, not in hedge mode
  - Properly sends `positionSide` parameter when in hedge mode
  - Added circuit breaker to prevent infinite retry loops (disables after 3 failures)
  - Enhanced position validation before attempting closure
  - Improved error handling for various API error codes (-1106, -2022, -2019)
- **Database Location Issue** - bot.db now correctly created in data/ directory instead of root
  - Updated config.py to use absolute path for database
  - Added automatic data directory creation if it doesn't exist
  - Ensured all database connections use the correct path
- **Margin Calculation Logic** - Improved handling for isolated and cross positions
- **Position Monitor** - Enhanced TP/SL fill handling and close logic
- **Re-entrant Locking** - Replaced Lock with RLock in PositionMonitor for thread safety
- **Multi-Assets Mode** - Enhanced error handling for mode changes
- **Recovery Cooldown** - Reduced cooldown time and improved margin type error handling

### 🛠️ Changed
- **Startup Architecture** - Complete redesign of service initialization
  - Services now start in dependency order with shared state
  - Reduced API calls by 70% through intelligent state caching
  - Health checks validate system readiness before starting services
  - Improved startup time through parallel initialization where possible
- **Order Management** - Enhanced with state tracking and caching
  - OrderCleanup now checks state cache before attempting cancellations
  - PositionMonitor integration with StateManager for order tracking
  - Reduced database lock contention through optimized queries
- **Logging System** - Reduced verbosity in batch order logging for cleaner output
- **Trade Filtering** - Enhanced filtering capabilities with improved performance
- **Liquidation Notifications** - Toast notifications now display USDT values
- **Documentation** - Condensed and improved clarity across all docs

### 🧪 Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Added unit and integration tests for position monitor
  - Unit tests for hedge mode order parameter validation
  - Integration tests for instant profit capture flow
  - Circuit breaker activation tests
  - Order parameter verification script for debugging

### 🏗️ Technical Improvements
- **Performance Metrics**
  - 70% reduction in redundant API calls through state caching
  - Eliminated race conditions during startup
  - Faster service initialization with shared exchange state
  - Improved error recovery with intelligent cooldown periods
- **New Architecture Components**
  - `src/utils/state_manager.py` - Centralized state management with caching
  - `src/core/service_coordinator.py` - Service orchestration and dependency management
  - `src/utils/event_bus.py` - Asynchronous event-driven communication
- **Code Quality**
  - Better separation of concerns through event-driven architecture
  - Reduced coupling between services
  - Improved observability with statistics tracking
